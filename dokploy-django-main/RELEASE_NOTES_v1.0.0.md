## ✅ What Makes This Different

**Real production insights** - Not just theory:
- Spent hours debugging CSRF issues → discovered Django was loading wrong settings file
- Struggled with PostgreSQL connections → found containers use 172.18.x, not 172.17.x
- Hit missing dependency errors → documented comprehensive dependency checking
- Frontend connection issues → documented environment variable configuration

**Every mistake documented** so you don't have to make them!
